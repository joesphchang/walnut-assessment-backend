# Walnut Assessment Backend

## Description
This is a backend for the walnut assessment that was assigned to me. I created this back-end using Node.JS, Express.JS and MongoDB to store my data. I utilized Chai & Mocha to set up my test. 

This API stores data of a user that has an author, authorId, likes, popularity, reads and a array of tags. I utilized Postman to test out whether or not I received data. 

The assessment was to create a simple GET request to the API. 

## Technologies Used
Node.js 
Express.Js
MongoDB
Postman
